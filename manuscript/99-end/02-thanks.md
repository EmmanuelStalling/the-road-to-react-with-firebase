# Thank You

So now we've reached the end of The Road to React with Firebase. I hope you enjoyed reading it, and I hope it helped you to gain some traction in React with Firebase. If you liked the book, share it as a way to learn Firebase in React with your friends. It should be used as giveaway. Also, a review on Amazon or Goodreads can really help improve future projects.

Foremost, I want to thank you for reading this book or taking the full course. My greatest wish is that you had a great learning experience with the material. I hope you feel empowered now to build your own applications that uses Firebase. I strive to go in the direction of education, so I depend on your feedback, both positive and critical.

Visit [my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more topics about software and web development, and I have updates are available by [subscription](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch). The updates will be in-depth content, but never spam.

If you liked the learning experience, I hope you share it with others. Think about people in your life who want to learn more about Firebase to build sophisticated web applications with a minimalistic tech stack.

Thanks for reading,
Robin.
