## Requirements

To get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with the basics of web development, which includes knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/) mentions several things that should be kinda familiar regarding JavaScript before you start to read this book. You will also need to be familiar with the term API, which I explained over [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/), because APIs are discussed and used frequently while building the application(s) from this book.

### Editor and Terminal

For the development environment, use a running editor/terminal (command line tool) or IDE with integrated terminal. Therefore, [follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/) if you don't have the tools on your machine yet. The guide is adjusted for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide, too.

### Node and NPM

You will need to have [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which are used to run the applications we'll build and manage the libraries we'll use along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks. You can verify which node and npm versions you have in the command line.

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v10.11.0
npm --version
*v6.5.0
~~~~~~~~

These are the versions used for this publication. If you don't see output in your terminal, you will need to install node and npm. The latter usually comes with the installation of the former.

### React

This book **uses Firebase to enable you writing business applications with React without worrying about a backend application**. My other book called The Road to learn React teaches you all the fundamentals about React. It also teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. The book is available for free and after having read The Road to learn React, you should possess all the knowledge to implement the application(s) from this book.
